# NoSQL

## Overview

NoSQL(Not only SQL) is a database management approach where data can be represented with more than one model: tabular, document, key-value pairs and graphical. Unlike SQL representation, it's not limited to rows and columns. This diversified representation introduces flexibility, scaling and simplicity in manipulating and managing data. In this directory, we dive into MongoDB, a NoSQL database management system(DBMS) that uses the document model. Exercises here explore CRUD operations and how to integrate python with MongoDB using pymongo. Happy coding.
